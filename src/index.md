3RVX
====

One thing Windows always lacked was an on-screen display (OSD) for multimedia events like the volume changing or a drive being ejected. While the latest versions of Windows do have a built-in OSD, it is relatively simple. That's where 3RVX comes in: it's a highly customizable service that provides an on-screen display, hotkey controls, tray notifications, and more. Here's a look at some of the 'skins' that completely change the volume OSD's look and feel:
