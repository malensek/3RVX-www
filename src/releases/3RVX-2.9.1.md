3RVX 2.9.1
==========

Beta 9 of 3RVX 3 has a substantial number of changes, with automatic update functionality and support for the old v2 skin format being the two main benefits of the release. I will be speeding up the pace of new releases from this point on to help get changes pushed out faster and test automatic updates. From this point on, beta version numbers will be 2.9.X until the final 3.0 release.

There are a few new features planned for Beta 10 (new volume options, brightness OSD, keyboard OSD) and then the focus will shift toward stability and fixing some of the lingering bugs some users are experiencing.

As always, thanks for testing the latest releases, and enjoy!
