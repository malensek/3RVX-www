OSD Settings
============

Volume
------

Subscribe to system volume events
: Detects changes to the system volume level by other applications and displays the volume OSD when the changes occur. For example, changing the built-in Windows volume slider will cause the 3RVX OSD to display. If this is disabled, then the OSD will only be displayed when using 3RVX-based hotkeys.

Device Selector
: 3RVX normally monitors the system default audio output device, but a specific output device can be selected here.

Audio Taper Selector
: Volume is measured in decibels (dB), a logarithmic (nonlinear) scale. In other words, adding 5 dB to the system volume has a different effect on output loudness depending on the current level. To make an easy-to-understand volume slider ranging from 0 -- 100%, most operating systems apply an *audio taper* to the logarithmic volume curve to make it behave more like a linear scale; adding 5% to the volume level should increase the output loudness by roughly the same amount.
